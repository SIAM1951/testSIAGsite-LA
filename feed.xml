&lt;p&gt;The deadline for submitting input has been extended to 16 February, 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recommendations for locations within North America need not have a
local organizing committee, but it would be helpful to provide
justification on why the particular recommended location is a good
choice for the SIAM ALA Conference. Such recommendations can be
sent directly to Jim Nagy, SIAG/LA Chair, &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:jnagy@emory.edu&quot;&gt;jnagy@emory.edu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that it is possible to run the conference with limited or no SIAM
support or staff, or to hold the conference outside North America.
However, in these situations it is important to have a strong local
organizing team, and a formal proposal needs to be submitted to SIAM.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the ECP SLATE project, we are designing a standard C++ API for Batch
BLAS. We have published the initial draft of the proposed API as SLATE Working
Note #4:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icl.utk.edu/publications/swan-004&quot;&gt;http://www.icl.utk.edu/publications/swan-004&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the importance of such a standard, we would like to engage the broader
community in its development. To facilitate this collaboration, we have a SLATE
user mailing list. You can join this mailing list by going to the following URL:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IMA and the University of Birmingham are pleased to announce the Sixth IMA Conference on Numerical Linear Algebra and Optimization. The meeting is being held in cooperation with SIAM, and SIAM Activity Groups on Optimization and on Linear Algebra. SIAM members will receive the IMA members&amp;#8217; registration rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;##Scope##&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The success of modern codes for large-scale optimization is heavily dependent on the use of effective tools of numerical linear algebra. On the other hand, many problems in numerical linear algebra lead to linear, nonlinear or semidefinite optimization problems. The purpose of the conference is to bring together researchers from both communities and to find and communicate points and topics of common interest.
Conference topics include any subject that could be of interest to both communities, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Direct and iterative methods for large sparse linear systems&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Eigenvalue computation and optimization&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Large-scale nonlinear and semidefinite programming&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Effect of round-off errors, stopping criteria, embedded iterative procedures&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Optimization issues for matrix polynomials&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fast matrix computations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Compressed/sparse sensing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PDE-constrained optimization&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Distributed computing and optimization&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;phd-position-at-university-of-strathclyde&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;nav8&quot;&gt;PhD position at University of Strathclyde&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applications are invited for a fully funded 3 year PhD studentship in numerical linear algebra, under the supervision of Dr Jennifer Pestana and Dr Alison Ramage, at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotland. The project will begin 1 March, 2018, or earlier by arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project aims to develop novel preconditioned iterative methods for linear systems arising in the numerical approximation of partial differential equations via radial basis functions (RBFs). These RBF methods are well suited to problems with complex geometries and/or scattered data, such as those occurring in biological and geophysical applications. However, the linear system that must be solved as part of the RBF method becomes increasingly challenging to work with as the approximation is refined. This project will extend previous work on preconditioning RBF systems to provide more efficient and robust solvers for these problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The studentship covers UK/EU tuition fees and comes with an annual tax-free stipend at the standard UK rate. International students who can fund the difference between UK/EU and International fee rates are also encouraged to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applicants should have or expect to obtain a good (I or II(i)) honours degree in mathematics or in a related discipline. Experience of numerical mathematics and/or programming would be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Announcing the publication by SIAM of:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vector Extrapolation Methods with Applications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Avram Sidi &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Computational Science and Engineering 17&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important problem that arises in different disciplines of science and engineering is that of computing limits of sequences of vectors of very large dimension. Such sequences arise, for example, in the numerical solution of systems of linear and nonlinear equations by fixed-point iterative methods, and their limits are simply the required solutions to these systems. The convergence of these sequences, which is very slow in many cases, can be accelerated successfully by using suitable vector extrapolation methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vector Extrapolation Methods with Applications&lt;/em&gt; is the first book fully dedicated to the subject of vector extrapolation methods. It is a self-contained, up-to-date, and state-of-the-art reference on the theory and practice of the most useful methods. It covers all aspects of the subject, including development of the methods, their convergence study, numerically stable algorithms for their implementation, and their various applications. It also provides complete proofs in most places. As an interesting application, the author shows how these methods give rise to rational approximation procedures for vector-valued functions in the complex plane, a subject of importance in model reduction problems among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This book is intended for numerical analysts, applied mathematicians, and computational scientists and engineers in fields such as computational fluid dynamics, structures, and mechanical and electrical engineering, to name a few. Since it provides complete proofs in most places, it can also serve as a textbook in courses on acceleration of convergence of iterative vector processes, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Avram Sidi&lt;/strong&gt; is Professor Emeritus of Numerical Analysis in the Computer Science Department at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and the former holder of the Technion Administration Chair in Computer Science. He has published extensively in various areas of numerical analysis and approximation theory, such as convergence acceleration, numerical integration, rational approximation, and asymptotic analysis, convergence acceleration being a major area. He is also the author of the book Practical Extrapolation Methods: Theory and Applications (Cambridge University Press, 2003), which deals exclusively with the acceleration of convergence of scalar sequences. His research has involved the development of novel numerical methods of high accuracy, their rigorous mathematical analysis, design of efficient algorithms for their implementation, and their application to difficult problems. His methods and algorithms are being used successfully in various scientific and engineering disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;

Congress Center Basel, Switzerland (&lt;a href=&quot;https://pasc18.pasc-conference.org&quot;&gt;https://pasc18.pasc-conference.org&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PASC18 Organizing Team is pleased to announce that submissions are
now open for minisymposium, paper and poster contributions. We look
forward to receiving your submissions through the online submission
portal (&lt;a href=&quot;https://pasc18.pasc-conference.org/submission/submissions-portal/&quot;&gt;https://pasc18.pasc-conference.org/submission/submissions-portal/&lt;/a&gt;).
Please note that the November 26th deadline for minisymposia proposals
is rapidly approaching!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONFERENCE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PASC18 is the fifth edition of the PASC Conference series, an
international platform for the exchange of competences in scientific
computing and computational science, with a strong focus on methods,
tools, algorithms, application challenges, and novel techniques and
usage of high performance computing. The theme of PASC18 is Fast and
Big Data, Fast and Big Computation, emphasizing our vision of the
close coupling of data and computation. Exposing and expressing
massive and irregular parallelism in computational problems are key
challenges for exploiting the massive and heterogeneous parallelism
available in current, and expected in future, HPC systems, as well as
to find new ways of generating scientific insight from data and
models. Through its rich and interactive program, PASC18 aims to
highlight the computational approaches that computational scientists,
computer scientists, and practitioners employ today and will employ
over the next decades to address these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONTRIBUTIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PASC18 welcomes submissions for minisymposium, paper, and poster
contributions that demonstrate innovative research in scientific
computing related to the following scientific domains:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chemistry and Materials&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Life Sciences&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Physics&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Climate and Weather&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Solid Earth Dynamics&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engineering&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Computer Science and Applied Mathematics&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Emerging Applications Domains (e.g. Social Sciences, Finance,&amp;#8230;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upcoming Submission Deadlines&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Minisymposia: November 26, 2017&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Papers: January 19, 2018&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Posters: February 4, 2018&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MINISYMPOSIA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A minisymposium at PASC18 is a two-hour session of four presentations
on a topic of current importance in computational science that
showcases research related to domain science, applied mathematics,
computer science or software engineering. Proposals should describe
research that is of significant current interest to a given PASC
scientific domain, and ideally, have potential application to
additional domains. Proposals should include speakers from multiple
institutions and/or countries, and be designed such that the speakers
bring a range of different perspectives to the topic. PASC18
encourages gender balance and diversity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PAPERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of the PASC papers program is to advance the quality of
interdisciplinary exchange between the various specific fields of
computational science and engineering. We welcome high-quality
contributions of original research related to scientific computing in
any of the eight PASC scientific domains. Papers will be evaluated by
domain experts primarily on their significance, technical soundness,
originality, and quality of communication. Papers accepted for PASC18
will be presented as talks, and published in the Proceedings of the
PASC Conference, accessible via the ACM Digital Library. A selection
of the highest quality papers may be given the opportunity of a
plenary presentation. In selecting papers for plenary presentation,
the Scientific Reviewing Committee will place particular weight on
impact, interdisciplinarity and interest to a broad audience.
Following the conference, authors will have the opportunity to further
develop their PASC papers for publication in a relevant,
computationally focused, domain-specific journal. Authors thus stand
to benefit from the rapid and broad dissemination of results afforded
by the conference venue and associated published proceedings, as well
as the impact associated with publication in a high-quality scientific
journal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;POSTERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poster presentations provide an ideal opportunity for the exchange of
ideas and expertise within and between the various computational
science domains represented at the conference. Poster submissions
should describe topical research related to domain science, applied
mathematics, computer science or software engineering. Poster
presenters will be given the possibility to &amp;#8220;pitch&amp;#8221; their posters to
the conference audience in a rapid-fire flash session, and posters
with the most stimulating content will be recognized in an award
ceremony on the final day of the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SIAG/LA Officers seek input on a location for the 
2021 SIAM Conference on Applied Linear Algebra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recommendations for locations within North America need not have a
local organizing committee, but it would be helpful to provide
justification on why the particular recommended location is a good
choice for the SIAM ALA Conference. Such recommendations can be
sent directly to Jim Nagy, SIAG/LA Chair, jnagy@emory.edu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that it is possible to run the conference with limited or no SIAM
support or staff, or to hold the conference outside North America.
However, in these situations it is important to have a strong local
organizing team, and a formal proposal needs to be submitted to SIAM.&lt;br /&gt;
For further details, see:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.siam.org/meetings/proposals/siag_run.php&quot;&gt;http://www.siam.org/meetings/proposals/siag_run.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deadline for submitting recommendations and/or proposals
is 4 February 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

solicited from researchers in numerical linear algebra, matrix theory,
and related areas such as optimization, differential equations, signal
processing, and control. Each attendee will be given the opportunity
to present a talk or a poster. Some talks will be plenary lectures, 
while others will be shorter presentations arranged in parallel sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application deadline will be some time in Fall 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is expected that partial support will be available for some

        <title>Householder Symposium XX</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article on the Householder Symposium XX was written by Jessica Bosch from the University of British Columbia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This summer, I attended the Householder Symposium XX in Blacksburg, Virginia. It was my first time in Virginia as well as my first time attending this fabulous meeting. I was pleased to be invited for a poster presentation and to had the chance to meet other young and  established researchers. It&amp;#8217;s a tradition of the meeting to be informal, and I felt very comfortable due to its friendly atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientific program consisted of diverse plenary talks, parallel sessions, as well as poster presentations supported by two entertaining poster blitz sessions on the first two evenings of the event. The symposium is well-known for the high-quality research presentations about state-of-the-art numerical linear and multi-linear algebra as well as related areas including optimization and systems and control. For example, Silvia Gazzola introduced a new fast solver, based on a flexible Krylov method, for nonnegative least squares problems in her talk on &amp;#8220;Enforcing Nonnegativity by Flexible Krylov Subspaces&amp;#8221;. Nick Trefethen gave an enjoyable presentation on &amp;#8220;Block Operators and Spectral Discretizations&amp;#8221;, which recently appeared in SIAM Review and has potential use in the classroom as well. In his talk on &amp;#8220;Linear-Quadratic Optimal Control of Differential-Algebraic Equations,&amp;#8221; Matthias Voigt presented feasibility criteria in terms of the solutions of the general Lur&amp;#8217;e equation and discussed aspects on the numerical construction of the solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A highlight of the symposium was the presentation of the 16th Alston S. Householder Award to Edgar Solomonik (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) for the best PhD dissertation in numerical linear algebra submitted between January 2014 and December 2016. Edgar&amp;#8217;s dissertation on &amp;#8220;Provably Efficient Algorithms for Numerical Tensor Algebra&amp;#8221; was selected by an international committee consisting of Michele Benzi, Inderjit Dhillon, Howard Elman (chair), Andreas Frommer, Francoise Tisseur, and Stephen Vavasis. In the morning after the conference banquet, Edgar gave the Householder Prize lecture, titled &amp;#8220;Towards an Algebraic Formalism for Scalable Numerical Algorithms&amp;#8221;, and you can check out his slides &lt;a href=&quot;http://solomonik.cs.illinois.edu/talks/householder-pz-vtech-jun-2017.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first social highlight was a welcome BBQ with live music and members of the local organizing committee serving the beer. For the traditional excursion, participants could choose between three options: (1) a hike by one of Virginia&amp;#8217;s most beautiful waterfalls, followed by local beer tasting; (2) wine tasting in Roanoke, followed by a short hike; or (3) a vigorous hike to one of Virginia&amp;#8217;s most interesting rock formations. Due to my foot injury, I could not join the tough hike but others were excited about it. I attended the wine tasting, which was enjoyable as well. The waiter was quite quick in serving, so we tasted a good number of wines and snacked on some cheese and meat. In the end, we could take the fancy wine glasses home. The evening continued with a wonderful conference banquet. Cleve Moler, the after-dinner speaker, looked back to previous Householder Symposia and showed an interesting photo series. During lunches, participants were assigned to random tables which supported networking with diverse researchers. Another highlight was the live music and dance evening, with Beresford Parlett being one of the first dancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me conclude my review with citing a joke by Chen Greif during his plenary talk on &amp;#8220;Recent Advances in the Solution of Saddle-Point Systems&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; Question: Can you solve a saddle point problem? Answer: Schur!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jessica Bosch is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of British Columbia. Her research interests include numerical linear algebra, particularly preconditioning and the itrative solution of linear systems, the numerical solution of phase field models. Her website can be found here:
