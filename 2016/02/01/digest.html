<p>Networks are emerging as a common language to model a wide variety of systems in life sciences, engineering, and social sciences. Real-world applications give rise to networks that are unstructured and often comprised of several components. Furthermore, they can support multiple dynamical processes that shape the network over time. The workshop will focus on processing and mining large-scale networks and is targeted for researchers and practitioners interested in data mining, machine learning, massive data analytics, network science, social networks and high performance computing in its broadest sense. Both theoreticians as well as practitioners, including system builders and individuals applying network analytic methods in application domains will be benefited from this workshop.</p>

<p>Papers are invited on topics including, but not limited to, the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Network Analytics</li>
  <li>Sequential, parallel distributed methods for computing structural properties of networks</li>

<p>The IMA and the University of Birmingham are pleased to announce the
Fifth IMA Conference on Numerical Linear Algebra and Optimization. The
meeting is co-sponsored by SIAM, whose members will receive the IMA
members&#8217; registration rate.</p>

<p>The success of modern codes for large-scale optimization is heavily
dependent on the use of effective tools of numerical linear
algebra. On the other hand, many problems in numerical linear algebra
lead to linear, nonlinear or semidefinite optimization problems. The
purpose of the conference is to bring together researchers from both
communities and to find and communicate points and topics of common
interest.</p>

<h3 id="conference-topics">CONFERENCE TOPICS</h3>
<p>Direct and iterative methods for large sparse
linear systems. Eigenvalue computation and optimization. Large-scale
nonlinear and semidefinite programming. Effect of round-off errors,
stopping criteria, embedded iterative procedures. Optimization issues
for matrix polynomials. Fast matrix computations. Compressed/sparse
sensing. PDE-constrained optimization. Distributed computing and
optimization. Applications and real time optimization.</p>

<h3 id="important-dates-1">IMPORTANT DATES</h3>
<p>Mini-symposium proposals and contributed talks are invited on all
aspects of numerical linear algebra and optimization. Mini-symposium
proposals should be submitted to conferences@ima.org.uk by 31 March
2016. A mini-symposium is limited to at most two sessions on a single
topic (maximum eight speakers). Organisers will be advised of
acceptance by 11 April 2016. Contributed talks and mini-symposia talks
will be accepted on the basis of a one page extended abstract which
should be submitted by 30 April 2016 by e-mail to
conferences@ima.org.uk. Authors will be advised of acceptance by 31
May 2016. A book of abstracts will be made available to delegates at
the conference.</p>
