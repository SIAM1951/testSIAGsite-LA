<h3 id="conference-information">Conference Information</h3>
<p>With the continuing advances in high-performance computing, the role of computational science and engineering (CSE) has extensively grown in importance over the last decades. At the same time scientific simulations continue to face a number of challenges and generate massive amounts of data. Many of the underlying problems here are combinatorial in nature and unified by a common set of abstractions, data structures, and algorithms, often based on graphs and hypergraphs. On a related front, data science and analytics have emerged as powerful methods of inquiry across a broad range of domains and pose various fundamental challenges associated with size and complexity of data that would greatly benefit from combinatorial methods. CSC16 provides a forum for researchers interested in the interaction of combinatorial mathematics and algorithms with CSE and/or data science.</p>

<h3 id="conference-proceedings">Conference Proceedings</h3>
<p>CSC16 follows six successful CSC workshops held roughly biennially since 2004. A new feature of CSC16 is that there will be a peer-reviewed proceedings associated with the workshop. The proceedings will be published by SIAM and hosted at its platform <a href="http://epubs.siam.org/series/pr">http://epubs.siam.org/series/pr</a>. The papers will be made permanently available with DOI links. SIAM proceedings are indexed by major scientific bibliography databases.</p>

<p>Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present original unpublished research in all areas of combinatorial scientific computing. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to,</p>

<ul>
  <li>Combinatorial (discrete) models in scientific computing</li>
  <li>Graph and hypergraph algorithms in scientific computing</li>
  <li>Sparse matrix computations</li>
  <li>Combinatorial problems in data science and network science</li>
  <li>Combinatorial problems in Algorithmic Differentiation</li>

<p>Dear Friends and Colleagues <br />
With apologies for cross-postings.</p>

<p>We cordially invite you to contribute to the fourteenth annual &#8220;Modeling and OPtimization: Theory and Applications&#8221; (MOPTA) conference, organized at Lehigh University, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, August 17-19, 2016.</p>

<p>MOPTA aims at bringing together a diverse group of people from both discrete and continuous optimization, working on both theoretical and applied aspects.  There will be invited plenary talks from distinguished speakers as well as organized sessions and contributed talks, spread over three days.  Our target is to provide a diverse set of exciting new developments from different areas of optimization research while at the same time providing a setting which will allow increased interaction among the participants.  We aim to bring together researchers from both the theoretical and applied communities in the framework of a medium-scale event who do not usually have the chance to interact in larger meetings.</p>

<p>We welcome contributed talks, and we are also very interested in hearing from people who could organize a session centered around one of their topics of expertise. MOPTA sessions have 3 speakers, with 30 mins per presentation including Q&amp;A&#8217;s. Speakers will be kindly asked to submit their abstract on the MOPTA website. The deadline for abstract submission is May 20.</p>

<p>Confirmed plenary speakers</p>

<p>The success of modern codes for large-scale optimization is heavily dependent on the use of effective tools of numerical linear algebra. On the other hand, many problems in numerical linear algebra lead to linear, nonlinear or semidefinite optimization problems. The purpose of the conference is to bring together researchers from both communities and to find and communicate points and topics of common interest.</p>

<p>Conference topics include any subject that could be of interest to both communities, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Direct and iterative methods for large sparse linear systems.</li>
  <li>Eigenvalue computation and optimization.</li>
  <li>Large-scale nonlinear and semidefinite programming.</li>
  <li>Effect of round-off errors, stopping criteria, embedded iterative procedures.</li>
  <li>Optimization issues for matrix polynomials</li>
  <li>Fast matrix computations.</li>
  <li>Compressed/sparse sensing</li>
  <li>PDE-constrained optimization</li>
  <li>Distributed computing and optimization</li>
  <li>Applications and real time optimization</li>
