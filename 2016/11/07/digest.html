<p>Training-based Workforce Development for Advanced Cyberinfrastructure - CyberTraining 
(NSF 17-507)</p>

<p>Program Solicitation:</p>

<p>The overarching goal of this program is to prepare, nurture and grow the national scientific workforce for creating, utilizing, and supporting advanced cyberinfrastructure (CI) that enables cutting-edge science and engineering and contributes to the Nation&#8217;s overall economic competitiveness and security.  This solicitation calls for developing innovative, scalable training programs to address the emerging needs and unresolved bottlenecks in scientific and engineering workforce development of targeted, multidisciplinary communities, at the postsecondary level and beyond, leading to transformative changes in the state of workforce preparedness for advanced CI in the short and long terms.  In the short term, the projects shall result in innovative, scalable, informal training models and pilot activities, complementing and leveraging the state of art in curricular offerings, material, and best practices in academia and elsewhere.  In the long term, the projects should contribute to the larger goals of an educational ecosystem enabling &#8220;Computational and Data Science for All,&#8221; with an understanding of computation as the third pillar and data-driven science as the fourth pillar of the scientific discovery process.</p>

<p>There are three tracks for submissions:</p>

<p>(i) CI Professionals (CIP): aimed at the training and career pathway development of research cyberinfrastructure and professional staff who develop, deploy, manage, and support effective use of advanced CI for research;</p>

<p>(ii) Domain science and engineering (DSE): aimed primarily at the communities of CI Contributors and sophisticated CI Users, and aligned with the research and education priorities of the participating domain directorates; and</p>

<p>(iii) Computational and data science literacy (CDL): aimed at the CI User community at the undergraduate level.</p>

<p>The CyberTraining program includes all divisions within the Directorates of Engineering (ENG), Geosciences (GEO), and Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS), as well as the Divisions of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (ACI) and Computing and Communication Foundation (CCF) in the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), and the Division of Graduate Education (DGE) in the Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR).</p>

<p>Prospective PIs are strongly encouraged to contact the Cognizant Program Officers (POs) in CISE/ACI and in the participating directorate/division(s) relevant to the proposal at least a month in advance of the submission deadline to ascertain whether the focus and budget of the proposed activities are appropriate for this solicitation, and include the names of POs consulted in their Project Summary.</p>

<p>PASC17 Conference: Papers, Minisymposia and Posters Submissions</p>

<p>The Platform for Advanced Scientific Computing (PASC) is pleased to
announce that submissions will open on October 25 for the PASC17
Conference, co-sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery
(ACM). Submissions are invited for papers, minisymposia and poster

<p>The PASC Conference is an interdisciplinary conference in high-
performance computing that brings together domain science, applied
mathematics and computer science - where computer science is focused
on enabling the realization of scientific computation.</p>

<p>TARGET AUDIENCE<br />
The PASC17 Conference invites participants from academia, research
laboratories and industry to discuss the state of the art in
computational science in the context of high-performance computing.
The conference is an opportunity for researchers in computational
science to present innovative research that can help address societal
challenges of today and the future.</p>

<p>PROGRAM<br />
The PASC Conference offers three days of stimulating and thought-
provoking technical sessions, including keynote presentations,
minisymposia, peer-reviewed papers, panels and poster sessions. The
conference is co-sponsored by ACM SIGHPC, and papers are published in
the ACM Digital Library.</p>

<p>CONTRIBUTIONS<br />
Researchers from academia and industry are encouraged to participate
and present their research in the form of papers, minisymposia and/or
posters. PASC17 welcomes submissions in the following scientific fields:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Climate and Weather</li>
  <li>Computer Science and Mathematics</li>
  <li>Emerging Domains (Special topic: HPC and Precision Medicine)</li>
  <li>Engineering</li>
  <li>Life Sciences</li>
  <li>Materials Science and Chemistry</li>
  <li>Physics</li>
  <li>Solid Earth Dynamics</li>
</ul>

<p>PAPERS<br />
The goal of the PASC papers initiative is to advance the quality of
formal scientific communication between the relative disciplines of
computational science and engineering. Some disciplinary communities
traditionally publish in major, annual conferences, others primarily
in disciplinary journals, neither read regularly by the other
communities. PASC papers will enable the interdisciplinary exchange
in a manner bridging scientific publishing cultures and useful to the
individual and community research goals. Full submission guidelines
are provided through a separate call and are available
at <a href="http://www.pasc17.org/submission">http://www.pasc17.org/submission</a>.</p>
