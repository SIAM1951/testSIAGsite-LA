<h2 id="2017-householder-symposium-application-deadline-31-october"><a name="nav0">2017 Householder Symposium Application Deadline 31 October</a></h2>

<p>The Householder Symposium XX on Numerical Linear Algebra will be held
at The Inn at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, VA, USA, 18-23 June 2017.</p>

<p>Web page: <a href="http://www.math.vt.edu/HHXX/">http://www.math.vt.edu/HHXX/</a><br />
Application deadline: 31 October 2016<br />
Notification of acceptance: 15 February 2017</p>

<p>Attendance at the meeting is by invitation only. Applications are
welcome from researchers in numerical linear algebra, matrix theory,
and related areas such as optimization, differential equations, signal
processing, and control. Each attendee will be given the opportunity
to present a talk or a poster. Some talks will be plenary lectures,
while others will be shorter presentations arranged in parallel
sessions.</p>

<p>The Symposium is very informal, with the intermingling of young and
established researchers a priority. Participants are expected to
attend the entire meeting. It is expected that partial support will be
available for some students, early career participants, and
participants from countries with limited resources.</p>

<p>The sixteenth Householder Award for the best PhD thesis in numerical
linear algebra (PhD earned between 1 January 2014, and 31 December
2016) will be presented. Nominations for the Householder Award are due
by 31 January 2017.</p>

<p>The Householder Symposium takes place in cooperation with the Society
for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) and the SIAM Activity
Group on Linear Algebra.</p>

<h2 id="postdoc-opening-at-lawrence-berkeley-lab"><a name="nav7">Postdoc opening at Lawrence Berkeley Lab</a></h2>

<p>The Scalable Solvers Group in the Computational Research Division
at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has an immediate
opening for a postdoctoral fellow in large-scale traffic
modeling. The candidate will participate in research projects
to develop algorithms and software to predict near-future
traffic flow from real-time measurements, and to help traffic
management centers to improve performance of road networks and
reduce congestion. The projects will focus on the problem of
identifying trends in traffic patterns measured either on the
freeway, on arterials, or both. Computational challenges include
issues of model calibration, confidence, size and fidelity,
real-time analysis, and model coupling. The research activities
will include evaluation of existing algorithms using real data,
development of new algorithms especially parallel algorithms for
handing larger datasets, and integration of the new algorithms
into various simulation models, at both research level and
production level. Deliverables will include both software
distributions as well as publications targeted at top-tier
research conferences and journals.</p>
