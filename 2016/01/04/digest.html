<h2 id="new-from-siam-an-introduction-to-domain-decomposition-methods"><a name="nav1">New from SIAM: An Introduction to Domain Decomposition Methods</a></h2>

<p>Announcing the December 14, 2015, publication by SIAM of:</p>

<p>An Introduction to Domain Decomposition Methods:<br />
Algorithms, Theory, and Parallel Implementation
Victorita Dolean, Pierre Jolivet, Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Nataf</p>

<p>The purpose of this book is to offer an overview of the most
popular domain decomposition methods for partial differential
equations (PDEs). These methods are widely used for numerical
simulations in solid mechanics, electromagnetism, flow in porous
media, etc., on parallel machines from tens to hundreds of
thousands of cores. The appealing feature of domain
decomposition methods is that, contrary to direct methods, they
are naturally parallel.  The authors focus on parallel linear
solvers.</p>

<p>The authors present all popular algorithms, both at the PDE
level and at the discrete level in terms of matrices, along with
systematic scripts for sequential implementation in a free
open-source finite element package as well as some parallel
scripts. Also included is a new coarse space construction
(two-level method) that adapts to highly heterogeneous problems.</p>

<h3 id="audience">Audience</h3>

<p>This book is intended for those working in domain decomposition
methods, parallel computing, and iterative methods, in
particular those who need to implement parallel solvers for
PDEs. It will also be of interest to mechanical, civil, and
aeronautical engineers, physical and environmental scientists,
and physicists in need of parallel PDE solvers.</p>

<h3 id="about-the-authors">About the Authors</h3>

<p>Victorita Dolean is currently a Reader in the Department of
Mathematics and Statistics, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow,
United Kingdom. She has been a research assistant at the CMAP
(Center of Applied Mathematics) at the &Eacute;cole Polytechnique in
Paris, assistant professor at the University of Evry and at the
University of Nice, and visiting professor at the University of
Geneva. Her research has been oriented toward practical and
modern applications of scientific computing by developing
interactions between academic and industrial partners and taking
part in the life of the scientific community as a member of the
Board of Directors of SMAI (Society of Industrial and Applied
Mathematics in France).</p>

<p>Pierre Jolivet is a scientist at CNRS in the Toulouse Institute
of Computer Science Research, France, working mainly in the
field of parallel computing. Before that, he was an ETH Zurich
Postdoctoral Fellow of the the Scalable Parallel Computing Lab,
Zurich, Switzerland. He received his Ph.D. from Universit&eacute; de
Grenoble, France, in 2014 for his work on domain decomposition
methods and their applications on massively parallel
architectures. During his Ph.D., Pierre visited the Oak Ridge
National Laboratory, Tennessee, for three months in 2013. One of
his papers was nominated for the best paper award at
Supercomputing 2013.</p>

<p>Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Nataf is a senior scientist at CNRS in Laboratory
J.L. Lions at University Pierre and Marie Curie, France. He is
also part of an INRIA team. His field of expertise is in high
performance scientific computing (domain decomposition
methods/approximate factorizations), absorbing/PML boundary
conditions, and inverse problems. He has coauthored nearly 100
papers and given several invited plenary talks on these
subjects. He developed the theory of optimized Schwarz methods
and very recently the GENEO coarse space. This last method
enables the solving of very large highly heterogeneous problems
on large scale computers. The related paper was nominated for
the best paper award at Supercomputing 2013.</p>

<p>The Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms, introduced over 30 years ago, had a transformative effect on software for linear algebra. With the BLAS, researchers spend less time mapping algorithms onto specific features of hardware platforms and more time on interesting new algorithms.</p>

<p>Would it be practical to define an analogous set of basic building blocks for graph algorithms?  Can we define a core set of mathematical primitives from which we can build most (if not all) important graph algorithms? If we can agree on the mathematical foundations, how would these interact with the data structures used in graph algorithms and result in an API the graph algorithms research community could support?</p>

<p>These questions will be the topic for the second &#8220;Graph Algorithms Building Blocks&#8221; workshop.  Our goal is an interactive workshop where the full range of issues behind &#8220;Graph Algorithms Building Blocks&#8221; will be explored.   We want an interactive &#8220;workshop&#8221; so papers that report preliminary results and unproven but interesting ideas will also be considered.</p>

<h3 id="submission-and-dates">Submission and Dates</h3>

<p>Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including figures, tables, and references (see IPDPS Call for Papers for more details). Papers shorter than 10 pages are welcome. All papers will be peer-reviewed. Proceedings of the workshops are distributed at the conference and are submitted for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library after the conference.</p>

<p>To ensure the highest quality contributions, the ACM publication process includes multiple stages of review.</p>

<p>Authors should first submit an abstract for their paper; the abstracts will not be reviewed but are necessary for logistical reasons.</p>

<p>Authors will be invited to submit their full paper (pdf) shortly after 
abstract submission. These papers will undergo a first round of review, and the strongest papers will be selected for a second round of review. Authors will have the opportunity to revise their manuscripts based on feedback prior to the second round of reviews.</p>

<p>Submissions will be evaluated double blind (authors should not be listed 
in the (pdf) paper; references to own previous work should be in the third person). Papers should be in the <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/article-templates/proceedings-template.html">ACM proceedings format</a> and should be no more than 10 pages in length (including everything besides 
references, for which there is no limit). We suggest using &#8220;An Author&#8221;, &#8220;Another Author&#8221;, etc. in the ACM templates, and leaving affiliations and contact details blank.</p>

<h3 id="submission-deadlines">SUBMISSION DEADLINES</h3>

<p>To ensure a timely dissemination of research results, contributors are required to work according to the following schedule:</p>

<h3 id="scope">SCOPE</h3>

<p>Network science has a rich history, tracing its roots back 
through sociology, chemistry, biology, electrical engineering,
computer science, and topology all the way to Euler and the 
K&#246;nigsberg bridges nearly 300 years ago.  Network science 
studies the mathematical structure of the graphs that arise in 
these diverse fields, and the design, analysis, and applications
of algorithms that compute with and on them.  The goal of the 
SIAM Network Science workshop is to promote cross-fertilization 
among the communities that study and apply networks and graphs,
both inside and outside SIAM.</p>

<p>NS&#8217;16 will be co-located in Boston with the 2016 SIAM Annual 
Meeting (July 11-15) and the SIAM Conference on Life Sciences 
(July 11-14).</p>

<p>We cordially invite you to contribute to the fourteenth annual
&#8220;Modeling and OPtimization: Theory and Applications&#8221; (MOPTA) conference, organized at Lehigh University, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, August 17-19, 2016.</p>

<p>MOPTA aims at bringing together a diverse group of people from both discrete and continuous optimization, working on both theoretical and applied aspects.  There will be invited plenary talks from distinguished speakers as well as organized sessions and contributed talks, spread over three days.  Our target is to provide a diverse set of exciting new developments from different areas of optimization research while at the same time providing a setting which will allow increased interaction among the participants.  We aim to bring together researchers from both the theoretical and applied communities in the framework of a medium-scale event who do not usually have the chance to interact in larger meetings.</p>

<p>We welcome contributed talks, and we are also very interested in hearing from people who could organize a session centered around one of their topics of expertise. MOPTA sessions have 3 speakers, with 30 mins per presentation including Q&amp;A&#8217;s. Speakers will be kindly asked to submit their abstract on the MOPTA website. The deadline for abstract submission is May 20.</p>

<p>Confirmed plenary speakers (so far):</p>

  <li>Michael P. Friedlander (University of California, Davis)</li>
  <li>Jacek Gondzio (The University of Edinburgh)</li>
  <li>Michael Pinedo (New York University)</li>
