<p>###CONTENT
The school will focus on the effective exploitation of High
Performance Computing (HPC) systems. Current and coming generations of
HPC systems are increasing in size and complexity. Multi-core
processors, general purpose graphic accelerators (GPUs), many-cores
accelerators (MIC), ultra-fast parallel storage devices, and high
bandwidth low-latency networks are being combined to be used
effectively for scientific and technical computing. On suitable
classes of algorithms, outstanding performance can be achieved with
power efficiency significantly higher than traditional architectures,
considerably minimising overall times-to-solution of high-end
scientific problems. An efficient usage of such hybrid architectures
is not a trivial task, often requiring a full redesign and refactoring
of the code in order to expose those features that can be optimally
exploited by a given hardware component, as massively parallel
algorithmic components, that can be effectively accelerated by the
GPU, or overlapping computation and communication in order to scale on
thousands of CPUs. Traditional parallel programming approaches, based
on the message-passing paradigm, are no longer sufficient to fulfil
this task, and innovative solutions need to be addressed.</p>

<p>During the two weeks of the school a number of such solutions will be
presented. The MPI, OpenMP, CUDA, OpenACC programming models will be
introduced, together with scientific libraries and efficient I/O and
data visualisation solutions and optimisation techniques. Their
effective combined usage, in order to achieve an ideal exploitation of
large hybrid architectures, will be discussed and experimented with
extensive practical and exercise lab sessions to help clarify and
consolidate the theoretical material presented.</p>

<p>The following topics will be covered:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Message passing programming model and the MPI standard</li>
  <li>Shared memory systems and the OpenMP programming model</li>
  <li>Scientific libraries</li>
  <li>MPI I/O and other solutions for efficient data reading and writing</li>
  <li>GPU programming with CUDA and OpenACC</li>
  <li>Code optimization</li>
  <li>Scientific visualisation</li>
</ul>

<p>The 22nd Industrial Mathematical &amp; Statistical Modeling (IMSM) Workshop for Graduate Students will take place at North Carolina State University, 17-27 July 2016.  The workshop is sponsored by the Statistical and Applied Mathematical Science Institute (SAMSI) together with the Center for Research in Scientific Computation (CRSC) and the Department of Mathematics at North Carolina State University.</p>

<p>The IMSM workshop exposes graduate students in mathematics,
engineering, and statistics to exciting real-world problems from industry and government. The workshop provides students with experience in a research team environment and exposure to possible career opportunities. On the first day, a Software Carpentry bootcamp will bring students up-to-date on their programming skills in Python/Matlab and R, and introduce them to version control systems and software repositories.</p>

<p>Local expenses and travel expenses will be covered for students at US institutions. The application deadline is 15 May 2016.
