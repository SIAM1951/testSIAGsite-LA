<p>Are you struggling with how to improve diversity and inclusion within your organization? Would you like to hear and share ideas with others? Attend (or point a colleague to) the plenary panel session on &#8220;Strategies for Promoting Diversity and Inclusion within our Profession&#8221;, to be held at SIAM CSE19 Monday Feb 25 at 6pm (full details below).</p>

<p>We have an amazing line-up of panelists, all with experience and stories to share. The panel will be moderated by SIAM President Lisa Fauci. Our goal is to have this panel spark an engaged discussion with all attendees, and have everyone leave with at least one new idea to take back to their home institutions.</p>

<p>We hope to see you there.</p>

<p>On behalf of the panel organizers</p>

<p>Description
As a professional society, SIAM supports its members in taking on the biggest challenges in the field. This panel is focused on one such challenge: inadequate representation of under-represented groups such as women and minorities.  Our panelists have carefully studied the issue from different viewpoints and implemented various solutions. Their remarks will be focused on concrete actions for improving our profession in this regard. Join the discussion as we address questions such as&#8230;</p>
<ul>
  <li>What are the biggest obstacles that our field faces in achieving better diversity and inclusion?</li>
  <li>What is the most successful diversity and inclusion strategy/action you have personally led or experienced?</li>
  <li>What have you tried and found not to work?</li>
  <li>What are your three top recommendations for actions that departments / individuals can take?</li>
</ul>
