<h2 id="a-namenav2aa-hrefhttpswwwmathstcdieksoodhabeyonddiscrete2019hmi-workshop---beyond-the-discrete-iterative-methods-from-the-continuum-perspectivea"><a name="nav2"></a><a href="https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~ksoodha/beyonddiscrete2019/">HMI Workshop - Beyond the discrete: iterative methods from the continuum perspective</a></h2>
<p>The Hamilton Mathematics Institute (HMI) at Trinity College Dublin will be hosting a workshop next summer titled &#8220;Beyond the discrete: iterative methods from the continuum perspective&#8221;. Its purpose is to advance a more full view of iterative methods, which connects the measure of convergence in finite dimensions to the underlying continuum problem and the discretization that induced the finite dimensional linear system in question.  We seek to introduce these ideas to younger researchers in the early stages of their careers while bringing together current leaders in the field to have fruitful discussions and share their latest research. This workshop will combine introductory lectures on interrelated subtopics and hosting and encouraging interesting discussions.  There will also be a poster session wherein younger researchers can present their work.</p>

<p>The workshop has five invited speakers confirmed: Victorita Dolean (University of Strathclyde/Nice), Maya Neytcheva (Uppsala University), Catherine Powell (University of Manchester), Zdenek Strako&#353; (Charles University Prague), and Walter Zulehner (Johannes Kepler University, Austria).</p>

<p>The Workshop will take place from the morning of June 3 to lunchtime of June 7, 2019 in the Hamilton Building of Trinity College Dublin in Ireland. More detailed information, including how to register, can be found at <a href="https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~ksoodha/beyonddiscrete2019/">https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~ksoodha/beyonddiscrete2019/</a>.  We encourage interested colleagues to register and book hotel reservations as soon as possible, as the demand for hotel rooms is exceedingly high during the summer months, particularly in June.</p>

<p>Important Deadlines:<br />
March 20, 2019: Registration with talk/poster abstract submission (for early career people)<br />
March 20, 2019: Registration with request for possible limited financial support (for early career people)<br />
May 20, 2019: General registration deadline</p>

<p>2019 Gene Golub SIAM Summer School on High Performance Data Analytics</p>

<h4 id="about-the-program">About the program</h4>

<p>The 10th Gene Golub SIAM Summer School will take place in France, at a conference center in Aussois, in the French Alps from June, 17 to June, 28, 2019 and will be held in conjunction with the SIAM Activity Group on Supercomputing. The intended audience is intermediate graduate students (students with a Master&#8217;s degree, Ph.D. students, or equivalent).</p>

<p>The focus of the school will be on large-scale data analytics, which lies at the intersection of data analytics algorithms and high performance computing. Students will be introduced to problems in data analytics arising from both the machine learning and the scientific computing communities. The school will include perspectives from industry, such as Hodge Star Scientific Computing, IBM, and NVIDIA, as well as from academic instructors, including</p>

<ul>
  <li>Animashree Anandkumar (Caltech and Nvidia)</li>
  <li>Haesun Park (Georgia Institute of Technology)</li>
  <li>Tammy Kolda (Sandia National Laboratories)</li>
  <li>Jack Poulson (Hodge Star Scientific Computing)</li>
  <li>Costas Bekas (IBM)</li>
</ul>

<p>All courses will have a strong computing component. The school will be held in the spirit of Gene Golub, with lots of interactions between the lecturers and the participants.  A poster blitz and a poster session will be organized for students who wish to present their own work. The lectures will have associated labs that will allow the students to get hands-on experience and have a closer interaction with the lecturers. The school is being organized by Laura Grigori (Inria and Sorbonne University), Matthew Knepley (University at Buffalo), Olaf Schenk (Universit&agrave; della Svizzera italiana), and Rich Vuduc (Georgia Institute of Technology).</p>

<h2 id="a-namenav5two-tenure-track-assistant-professor-positions-ices-ut-austina"><a name="nav5">Two Tenure-track Assistant Professor positions, ICES, UT Austin</a></h2>

<p>The Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences (ICES) at The University of Texas at Austin is an interdisciplinary research and education institute focused on transforming science, engineering, and medicine through computation. ICES invites applicants for two tenure-track assistant professor faculty positions.</p>

<p>The first position is at the interfaces of Data Science and Computational Science. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to, computational statistics, machine learning, graph theory, randomized linear algebra, and tensor methods. Candidates should have a strong connection to challenging applications in science, engineering and/or medicine. Candidates should be committed to establishing an interdisciplinary research program at the intersection of advanced mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques, high-performance computing, and target applications. The successful candidate will be appointed in an appropriate department at UT, depending on their research and teaching interests.</p>

<p>The second position is in the area of Computational Medicine. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to, computational oncology, computational cardiology, computational neurosciences, and imaging science. Candidates should be committed to establishing an interdisciplinary research program at the intersection of target medical problems and advanced mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques. The successful candidate will be appointed in an appropriate department at UT, depending on their research and teaching interests. This includes the possibility of an appointment at the new Dell Medical School.</p>

<p>Review of applications will begin January 15, 2019.
Full details on both positions can be found at <a href="https://www.ices.utexas.edu/about/jobs/">https://www.ices.utexas.edu/about/jobs/</a></p>

<h2 id="a-namenav6postdoctoral-position-numerical-linear-algebra-university-of-edinburgha"><a name="nav6">Postdoctoral position, Numerical Linear Algebra, University of Edinburgh</a></h2>

<p>Applications are invited for a 3-year postdoctoral position as part of an EPSRC project in the area of numerical linear algebra for PDE-constrained optimisation problems, with applications to data science. The successful candidate will join the research group of Dr John Pearson in the School of Mathematics, University of Edinburgh.</p>

<p>The project is funded by the EPSRC Grant &#8220;Modern Linear Algebra for PDE-Constrained Optimisation Models for Huge-Scale Data Analysis&#8221;, and by the University of Edinburgh. The successful candidate will contribute to the development of numerical methods and iterative solvers for huge-scale matrix systems arising from optimisation problems with PDE constraints, and will apply their techniques to cutting-edge problems from data science. Experience with PDE-constrained optimisation/inverse problems, and/or numerical methods for PDEs (including numerical linear algebra for solving matrix systems), is desirable. Expertise in a relevant programming language (e.g., Python, C++, MATLAB) is essential.</p>

<p>The position should be taken up in September 2019, or an alternative date by mutual agreement. Further particulars, as well as the application link, may be found at tinyurl.com/ybu9qmur.</p>

<p>Informal enquiries are encouraged, and may be made to John Pearson at <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#074;&#046;&#080;&#101;&#097;&#114;&#115;&#111;&#110;&#064;&#101;&#100;&#046;&#097;&#099;&#046;&#117;&#107;">&#074;&#046;&#080;&#101;&#097;&#114;&#115;&#111;&#110;&#064;&#101;&#100;&#046;&#097;&#099;&#046;&#117;&#107;</a>.
