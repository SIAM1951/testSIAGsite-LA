  <h3>SIAG/Linear Algebra Early Career Prize</h3>
</div>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.siam.org/activity/la/">SIAM Activity Group 
on Linear Algebra Early Career Prize</a>, 
established in 2017, is awarded to one outstanding early career 
researcher in the field of applicable linear algebra, for 
distinguished contributions to the field within six (6) years of 
receiving the PhD or equivalent degree as of January 1 of the 
year of the award.
</p>

<p>
The SIAG/LA will present the award at the SIAM Conference on Applied
Linear Algebra (LA18), to be held May 4-8, 2018, in Hong Kong.
</p>

<h3>Eligibility</h3>

<p>
The candidate's work must be a significant research contribution to 
the field of applicable linear algebra. The award recognizes an individual 
who has made outstanding, influential, and potentially long-lasting 
contributions to applicable linear algebra within six (6) years of receiving 
the PhD or equivalent degree as of January 1 of the year of the award. 
For the 2018 award, the candidate must have been awarded their PhD no earlier 
than January 1, 2012, and no later than the nomination deadline.
</p>

<p>
The contribution(s) for which the award is made must be publicly available 
and may belong to any aspect of applicable linear algebra in its broadest sense. 
The committee may consider exceptions to the six-year rule, for career 
interruptions or delays occurring, e.g., for child bearing, child rearing, 
or elder care. Graduate students are not eligible for this award. 
The award can be received only once in a lifetime.
</p>
 
<h3>Description of the Award</h3>
 
<p>The award will consist of a certificate containing the citation. 
The recipient is expected to attend the award ceremony, and SIAM will 
reimburse reasonable travel expenses to attend the conference 
and accept the award.</p>
 
<h3>Nominations</h3>
