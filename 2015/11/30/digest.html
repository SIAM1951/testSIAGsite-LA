<h2 id="2016-copper-mountain-student-paper-competition"><a name="nav3">2016 Copper Mountain Student Paper Competition</a></h2>

<p>The 14th Copper Mountain Conference on Iterative Methods (March 20-25,
2016) invites submissions to the student paper competition, see
<a href="http://grandmaster.colorado.edu/~copper/2016/student.php#Compete">http://grandmaster.colorado.edu/~copper/2016/student.php#Compete</a></p>

<p>Any current student, or any recent PhD graduate whose degree was awarded
after January 1, 2015, is eligible to submit a paper. Papers must
contain original unpublished research due mainly to the student. These
papers must be received before January 15, 2016. The student must be the
primary author and the paper may be no more than 10 pages in length.</p>

<p>The paper must be emailed as an attachment in PDF format to
<code class="highlighter-rouge">copper@colorado.edu</code> and identified in the email as an entry for the 2016
student paper competition. In addition to emailing the paper, an
abstract for the paper must be submitted through our Abstract Submission
form. Sending only an abstract is unacceptable. A panel of judges will
determine the best papers.</p>

<p>The Copper Mountain Conference offers reduced student registration rates
and awards to pay for lodging and conference expenses for students,
subject to NSF funding. Postdocs are not they eligible for student
registration fees or lodging support. Students seeking support should
email the conference coordinator, Annette Anthony,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">annetteFanthony@gmail.com</code>, for more information.</p>

<p>The 2016 conference also features a Workshop on Iterative Linear
Algebraic Data Mining Techniques Workshop (Sunday, March 20 - Tuesday,
March 22), which may be of special interest to students, see

<h2 id="siam-workshop-on-combinatorial-scientific-computing-2016-csc16"><a name="nav4"></a><a href="http://www.siam.org/meetings/csc16/">SIAM Workshop on Combinatorial Scientific Computing 2016 (CSC16)</a></h2>
<p>With the continuing advances in high-performance computing, the role of computational science and engineering (CSE) has extensively grown in importance over the last decades. At the same time scientific simulations continue to face a number of challenges and generate massive amounts of data. Many of the underlying problems here are combinatorial in nature and unified by a common set of abstractions, data structures, and algorithms, often based on graphs and hypergraphs. On a related front, data science and analytics have emerged as powerful methods of inquiry across a broad range of domains and pose various fundamental challenges associated with size and complexity of data that would greatly benefit from combinatorial methods. CSC16 provides a forum for researchers interested in the interaction of combinatorial mathematics and algorithms with CSE and/or data science.</p>

<p>CSC16 follows five successful CSC workshops held roughly biennially since 2004. A new feature of CSC16 is that there will be a peer-reviewed proceedings associated with the workshop. The proceedings will be published by SIAM and hosted at its platform <a href="http://epubs.siam.org/series/pr">http://epubs.siam.org/series/pr</a>. The papers will be made permanently available with DOI links. SIAM proceedings are indexed by major scientific bibliography databases.</p>

<p>Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present original unpublished research in all areas of combinatorial scientific computing. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to,</p>

<ul>
  <li>Combinatorial (discrete) models in scientific computing</li>
  <li>Graph and hypergraph algorithms in scientific computing</li>
  <li>Sparse matrix computations</li>
  <li>Combinatorial problems in data science and network science</li>
  <li>Combinatorial problems in Algorithmic Differentiation</li>
  <li>Combinatorial problems in optimization</li>
  <li>Applications of combinatorial scientific computing</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="types-of-submissions">Types of Submissions</h3>

<p>We invite two types of submissions.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Full Papers. Papers should not exceed ten (10) pages using double-column format and 11 pt font size.

Accepted papers will be included in the proceedings, which will be published electronically by SIAM at its proceedings platform. Accepted papers will be presented at the workshop as talks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Extended Abstracts. Abstracts should not exceed 2 pages using double-column format and 11 pt font size. Accepted abstracts will be presented as talks at the workshop, but will not be published in the proceedings.</p>
  </li>
