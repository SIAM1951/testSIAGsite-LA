<p>Dear colleagues,</p>

<p>The 87th Annual Meeting of the International Association of Applied
Mathematics and Mechanics (GAMM) will take place from 7th to the 11th
of March 2016 in Braunschweig, Germany
(<a href="http://jahrestagung.gamm-ev.de/index.php">http://jahrestagung.gamm-ev.de/index.php</a>).</p>

<p>We are pleased to inform you that GAMM 2016 conference is jointly
organized with the German Mathematical Society
(<a href="https://dmv.mathematik.de/">https://dmv.mathematik.de/</a>).</p>

<p>On behalf of the organizing committee we would like to invite you, your
colleagues, postdocs, PhD and master students to take an active part in
Section S17, &#8220;APPLIED AND NUMERICAL LINEAR ALGEBRA.&#8221;</p>

<p>In general, contributed talks will have a length of 15 minutes plus 5
minutes for discussion. Once the abstracts have been received, depending
on the number of submissions and allowed time slots, we may have to select
an appropriate number of abstracts for presentations.</p>

<p>Please note that there will be four keynote lectures, each 35 minutes long,
distributed over the section sessions accordingly. We are greatly honored
that the following four speakers have agreed to present their work within
Section S17:</p>

<h2 id="modeling-and-optimization-theory-and-applications-mopta"><a name="nav5"></a><a href="http://coral.ie.lehigh.edu/~mopta">Modeling and OPtimization: Theory and Applications (MOPTA)</a></h2>
<p>We cordially invite you to contribute to the fourteenth annual
&#8220;Modeling and OPtimization: Theory and Applications&#8221; (MOPTA) conference, organized at Lehigh University, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, August 17-19, 2016.</p>

<p>MOPTA aims at bringing together a diverse group of people from both discrete and continuous optimization, working on both theoretical and applied aspects.  There will be invited plenary talks from distinguished speakers as well as organized sessions and contributed talks, spread over three days.  Our target is to provide a diverse set of exciting new developments from different areas of optimization research while at the same time providing a setting which will allow increased interaction among the participants.  We aim to bring together researchers from both the theoretical and applied communities in the framework of a medium-scale event who do not usually have the chance to interact in larger meetings.</p>

<p>We welcome contributed talks, and we are also very interested in hearing from people who could organize a session centered around one of their topics of expertise. MOPTA sessions have 3 speakers, with 30 mins per presentation including Q&amp;A&#8217;s. Speakers will be kindly asked to submit their abstract on the MOPTA website. The deadline for abstract submission is May 20.</p>

<p>Confirmed plenary speakers (so far):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Michael P. Friedlander (University of California, Davis)</li>
  <li>Jacek Gondzio (The University of Edinburgh)</li>
  <li>Michael Pinedo (New York University)</li>

of the leading facilities for scientific computing and to develop
professional maturity for self-directed independent research.</p>

<p>The fellowship provides opportunities to work on some of the most
important research challenges in computing sciences, from the
architecture and software of next generation high performance
computing systems and networks, to mathematical modeling, algorithms,
and applications of advanced computing to astrophysics, cosmology,
chemical sciences, materials science, climate change, biology and
other scientific domains.  The successful candidate will be able to
interact and collaborate with Berkeley Lab researchers that develop
and apply the latest technologies to computational modeling,
simulation, and data analytics for scientific discovery.</p>
