<h2 id="phd-position-at-university-of-strathclyde"><a name="nav8">PhD position at University of Strathclyde</a></h2>

<p>Applications are invited for a fully funded 3 year PhD studentship in numerical linear algebra, under the supervision of Dr Jennifer Pestana and Dr Alison Ramage, at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotland. The project will begin 1 March, 2018, or earlier by arrangement.</p>

<p>This project aims to develop novel preconditioned iterative methods for linear systems arising in the numerical approximation of partial differential equations via radial basis functions (RBFs). These RBF methods are well suited to problems with complex geometries and/or scattered data, such as those occurring in biological and geophysical applications. However, the linear system that must be solved as part of the RBF method becomes increasingly challenging to work with as the approximation is refined. This project will extend previous work on preconditioning RBF systems to provide more efficient and robust solvers for these problems.</p>

<p>The studentship covers UK/EU tuition fees and comes with an annual tax-free stipend at the standard UK rate. International students who can fund the difference between UK/EU and International fee rates are also encouraged to apply.</p>

<p>Applicants should have or expect to obtain a good (I or II(i)) honours degree in mathematics or in a related discipline. Experience of numerical mathematics and/or programming would be beneficial.</p>

<p>For more information please see <a href="http://siags.siam.org/siagla/jobs.html">http://siags.siam.org/siagla/jobs.html</a> or contact Dr Pestana (<a href="mailto:jennifer.pestana@strath.ac.uk">jennifer.pestana@strath.ac.uk</a>).</p>
