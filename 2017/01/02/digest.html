<p>Hello All,</p>

<p>Along with Michelle Girvan, I am co-organizing the 2017
SIAM Workshop on Network Science: <a href="http://www.siam.org/meetings/ns17/">http://www.siam.org/meetings/ns17/</a></p>

<p>It will take place in Pittsburgh, PA, USA on 13-14 July 2017, and it is
co-located with the SIAM Annual Meeting.</p>

<p>Abstract submissions (due 27 February) are now open, and the deadline for
early-career researchers to apply for travel support is 20 January. Invited
speakers will be announced shortly.</p>

<p>I hope to see you there!</p>

<h2 id="new-facebook-group-on-computational-science-and-engineering-topics"><a name="nav1">New Facebook group on Computational Science and Engineering topics</a></h2>

<p>Hello,</p>

<p>I decided to create a new facebook group to promote discussions on computational science topics which you can find at the following link and which I would be very glad if you could join:
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/695639740618486/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/695639740618486/</a></p>

<p>I hope that this group will then eventually serve as a launching pad for the creation of a proper network consultancy website for computational science and engineering projects where researchers active in this field can work (either paid or voluntarily depending on the offer) as freelance independent consultants on individual short-term projects of their choice proposed on the network by various companies, laboratories or research groups. Let me know in the group your opinion on this network consultancy project which I&#8217;m exploring at the moment.</p>

<p>Many thanks,<br />

Platform for Advanced Scientific Computing   <br />
PASC17 Conference  <br />
<a href="https://pasc17.pasc-conference.org/">https://pasc17.pasc-conference.org/</a><br />
<br />
Palazzo dei Congressi  <br />  
Lugano, Switzerland  <br />
June 26-28, 2017  <br />
</p>

<p>The Platform for Advanced Scientific Computing (PASC) is inviting
submissions for the PASC17 Conference, co-sponsored by the Association
for Computing Machinery (ACM) and SIGHPC, which will be held at the
Palazzo dei Congressi in Lugano, Switzerland, from June 26 to 28, 2017.</p>

<p>The PASC Conference is an interdisciplinary event in high performance
computing that brings together domain science, applied mathematics and
computer science - where computer science is focused on enabling the
realization of scientific computation.</p>

<p>The goal of the PASC papers initiative is to advance the quality of
scientific communication between the various disciplines of
computational science and engineering. The initiative is built from an
observation that the computer science community traditionally publishes
in the proceedings of major international conferences, while domain
science communities publish primarily in disciplinary journals - neither
of which is read regularly by the other disciplinary community. The PASC
papers initiative is focused on bringing these communities and
publishing cultures together.</p>

<p>By submitting papers to the PASC Conference, authors can benefit from
the rapid and broad dissemination of results afforded by the conference
venue and associated proceedings, as well as from the impact associated
with publication in a high-quality scientific journal (see below for
more details).</p>

<h4 id="submissions">SUBMISSIONS</h4>

<p>The PASC17 papers program is soliciting high-quality contributions of
original research relating to high performance computing in eight
domain-specific tracks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Climate and Weather</li>
  <li>Solid Earth Dynamics</li>
  <li>Life Sciences</li>
  <li>Chemistry and Materials</li>
  <li>Physics</li>
  <li>Computer Science and Applied Mathematics</li>
  <li>Engineering</li>
  <li>Emerging Domains in HPC</li>
</ul>

<p>Areas of interest include (but are not limited to):</p>

<ul>
  <li>The use of advanced computing systems for large-scale scientific
applications</li>
  <li>Implementation strategies for science applications in energy-efficient
computing architectures</li>
  <li>Domain-specific languages, libraries or frameworks</li>
  <li>The integration of large-scale experimental and observational
scientific data and high-performance data analytics and computing</li>
  <li>Best practices for sustainable software development and scientific
application development</li>
</ul>

<p>Papers should be between 5 and 10 pages in length, including figures,
tables and appendices, but not references, for which there are no
limits. Contributions should be submitted through the PASC17 online
submissions portal at</p>

<p><a href="https://pasc17.pasc-conference.org/submission/submissions-portal/">https://pasc17.pasc-conference.org/submission/submissions-portal/</a></p>

<h4 id="submissions-deadlines---extended">SUBMISSIONS DEADLINES - EXTENDED</h4>

<p>The review process is designed in the following stages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>January 23, 2017: Submissions close</li>
  <li>February 20, 2017: First review notification</li>
  <li>March 13, 2017: Revised submissions close</li>
  <li>April 11, 2017: Final review notification</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="pasc17-conference-and-proceedings-publication">PASC17 CONFERENCE AND PROCEEDINGS PUBLICATION</h4>

<p>Accepted manuscripts will be published in the ACM Digital Library at the
time of the PASC17 Conference, June 26-28, 2017. Authors will be given
30-minute presentation slots at the conference, grouped in topically
focused parallel sessions.</p>

<h4 id="post-conference-journal-submission">POST-CONFERENCE JOURNAL SUBMISSION</h4>

<p>Following the conference authors will have the opportunity to develop
their papers, and, where appropriate, associated open-source software,
for publication in a relevant, computationally focused, domain-specific
journal. The journal paper should be an expanded version of the
conference paper (consistent with the ACM policy for major revisions
[1]) presenting a more complete description of the work - a fuller
introduction, deeper project description, additional results, etc. and
may be accompanied by associated open-source software.</p>

<p>To facilitate post-conference journal publications, the PASC Conference
has formed collaborative partnerships with a number of high-quality
scientific journals, including Computer Physics Communications (CPC)
[2], the Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems (JAMES) [3], and
ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software (ACM TOMS) [4]. Members of the
journals&#8217; editorial boards will work with the PASC Papers Committee in
reviewing PASC papers and in identifying papers to be extended and
submitted to partner journals. Authors should communicate their interest
in publishing with a partner journal during the review process. The
current membership of the PASC Partner Journal Editors Board is as
follows.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Prof. Stan Scott, Computer Physics Communications, Editor-in-Chief &amp;
Queen&#8217;s University, Belfast</li>
  <li>Dr. Robert Pincus, Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems
(JAMES), Editor-in-Chief &amp; University of Colorado/ NOAA Earth System
Research Laboratory</li>
  <li>Dr. Mike Heroux, ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software (TOMS),
Editor-in-Chief &amp; Sandia National Laboratory</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="review-process">REVIEW PROCESS</h4>

<p>The PASC17 Papers Committee, chaired by Dr. Jack Wells (Oak Ridge
National Laboratory) and Prof. Torsten Hoefler (ETH Zurich), is
responsible for reviewing submitted papers. The goal of the paper-
selection process is to combine the strengths of the conference and
journal publication schemes in order to execute an effective, high-
quality publication venue in large-scale computational science. We use
four key principles to design a paper selection process for PASC17: (1)
no pre-selected review committee, (2) short revision process, (3)
double-blind peer-review, and (4) expert reviewers suggested by primary
reviewers. For a more detailed discussion of this process see T.
Hoefler, &#8216;Selecting Technical Papers for an Interdisciplinary
Conference: The PASC Review Process&#8217;, in the Proceedings of the Platform
for Advanced Scientific Computing Conference (2016) [5]. Papers will be
evaluated on their significance, technical soundness, originality, and
quality of communication.</p>

<p>Papers should be in the ACM proceedings format [6]. As submissions will
be evaluated double blind, authors should not be named and references to
previous work should be in the third person. We suggest using &#8220;An
Author&#8221;, &#8220;Another Author&#8221;, etc., in the ACM templates, and leaving
affiliations and contact details blank.</p>

<p>[1] To distinguish between a new derivative work and a minor revision,
ACM uses, respectively, a rule of greater than or less than 25 percent
changed.<br />
