<p>Christine Klymko has kindly written about her experience as a 
postdoc at Lawrence Livermore National Lab, and the differences 
between academia, industry, and lab life. Having now transitioned to 
a staff researcher position, it&#8217;s clear that the experience has been 
a positive one! We are grateful to Christine for taking the time to 
share her thoughts, which will be valuable to PhD students 
and researchers considering what to do next.</p>

<p>An IEEE IPDPS 2017 Workshop</p>

<p>=== Scope and Goals ===</p>

<p>This workshop series started with the narrow goal of exploring the definition of a set of basic building blocks for graph algorithms (<a href="http://graphblas.org">http://graphblas.org</a>), analogous to the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) in numerical linear algebra. Over the years, our scope has expanded.  We&#8217;ve welcomed a wide range of papers into GABB covering graph computations with an emphasis on high-performance and parallel computing. We expect this trend to continue in 2017.</p>

<p>In particular, while we retain our focus on &#8220;building blocks&#8221; for graph computations (including those not based on linear algebra), we also welcome work that focuses on libraries and frameworks to support applications that use graph algorithms.</p>

<p>Our target audience is developers of graph algorithms, researchers in high-performance computing working on irregular applications, applied mathematicians working on fundamental algorithmic building blocks for graph computations, and application scientists using graphs in their computational work and data analysis.</p>

<p>=== Submission and Dates ===</p>

<p>Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11-inch pages (IEEE conference style), including figures, tables, and references (see IPDPS Call for Papers for more details). All papers will be peer-reviewed. Proceedings of the workshops are distributed at the conference and are submitted for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library after the conference.</p>

<h2 id="phd-studentship-novel-preconditioners-for-rbf-linear-systems"><a name="nav7">PhD Studentship: Novel Preconditioners for RBF Linear Systems</a></h2>

<p>Applications are invited for a fully funded 3 year PhD studentship in 
numerical linear algebra, under the supervision of Dr Jennifer Pestana
and Dr Alison Ramage, at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics 
at the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotland.</p>

<p>This project aims to develop novel preconditioned iterative methods 
for linear systems arising in the numerical approximation of partial 
differential equations via radial basis functions (RBFs). These RBF 
methods are well suited to problems with complex geometries and/or 
scattered data, such as those occurring in biological and geophysical 
applications. However, the linear system that must be solved as part 
of the RBF method becomes increasingly challenging to work with as the 
approximation is refined. This project will extend previous work on 
preconditioning RBF systems to provide more efficient and robust solvers 
for these problems.</p>

<p>The studentship covers UK/EU tuition fees and comes with an annual 
tax-free stipend at the standard UK rate. International students who 
can fund the difference between UK/EU and International fee rates are 
also encouraged to apply.</p>

<p>Applicants should have or expect to obtain a good (I or II(i)) honours 
degree in mathematics or in a related discipline. Experience of 
numerical mathematics and/or programming would be beneficial.</p>

<p>For more information please contact Dr Pestana (<a href="mailto:jennifer.pestana@strath.ac.uk">jennifer.pestana@strath.ac.uk</a>).</p>
