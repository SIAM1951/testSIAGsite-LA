<h2 id="2021-siam-ala-conference"><a name="nav0">2021 SIAM ALA Conference</a></h2>

<p>The SIAG/LA Officers seek input on a location for the 
2021 SIAM Conference on Applied Linear Algebra.</p>

<p>Recommendations for locations within North America need not have a
local organizing committee, but it would be helpful to provide
justification on why the particular recommended location is a good
choice for the SIAM ALA Conference. Such recommendations can be
sent directly to Jim Nagy, SIAG/LA Chair, jnagy@emory.edu.</p>

<p>Note that it is possible to run the conference with limited or no SIAM
support or staff, or to hold the conference outside North America.
However, in these situations it is important to have a strong local
organizing team, and a formal proposal needs to be submitted to SIAM.<br />
For further details, see:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.siam.org/meetings/proposals/siag_run.php">http://www.siam.org/meetings/proposals/siag_run.php</a></p>

is 4 February 2018.</p>
